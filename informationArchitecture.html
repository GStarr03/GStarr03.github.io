                <div>Sitemap for Slow & Common.</div>
                <p>The information architecture course had a group project that lasted for most of the semester. We were tasked with creating
                    an information environment for an organization that was focused on Degrowth. Many tasks were completed such as controlled
                    vocabulary, sitemaps, user personas, low fidelity wireframes, and high fidelity wireframes. I also learned about the 
                    different navigation systems that went into information architecture such as navigation, label, organization, and search systems.
                    This is the sitemap that our team created for an organization we called "Slow & Common."
                </p>

                <div>Low to High Fidelity wireframe</div>
                <p>Low fidelity wireframes are to quickly draft the structure of the website. They are made to look as simple as possible.
                    There are some descriptions to give an idea as to what a certain area would contain or do. It gives a chance to see how
                    all the systems will come together. The High fidelity wireframe features much more detail and style. It is closer to what
                    the actual product would look like. Here are the low and high fidelity wireframes I developed for a page labeled "Events & Campaigns."

            <div class="showcaseItemz">
                <img src="images/infoArch3.png" alt="Low to High fidelity wireframe">
                <img src="images/infoArch4.png" alt="High fidelity wireframe">
                <div>Second Low to High fidelity wireframes</div>
                <p> This is another low and high fidelity wireframe I made for a page called "Online Workshops." This page is how members would find
                    information for upcoming events. It acted as both the latest news and an archive of previous events. The listings descended from newest
                    to oldest by default. However, I added various filters, a search system, and local navigation so that a member would have the tools 
                    to find the information they need, be it for an upcoming event or a past one.
                </p>
                <p>This project was very fun for me. I gained experience in communication, working with a team over the web, and creating information
                    environments. I cannot help but sometimes analyze the information architecture of websites that I visit and determine how it can help
                    improve my development skills.
