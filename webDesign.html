                <p>The following semester I would create a second website for the web design technologies course. It is  still an introductory class, but this time
                    there is the addition of JavaScript, PHP, and SQL. Most of the assignments built on each other. However, the final project was a
                    scenario where we built a shop for an organization from scratch. I chose to build one for paleontologists.

                <div>Screenshot of the store</div>
                <p>The website featured a lot more styling, but at the same time it still looks very simple since it was the second website I ever created.
                    The project provided me the opportunity to enhance the skills I learned from the previous course. I learned new types of style and structure
                    that I applied during the creation of this website.

                <p> A major goal of this project was to setup a database and connect it to the website through the use of SQL
                    and PHP. I was required to create a form using internal JavaScript. While the course was a fine 
                    introduction to JavaScript and PHP, as well as a refresher for SQL, I still have a lot to learn.
