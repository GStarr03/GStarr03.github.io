                <div>Using Google Sites.</div>
                <p>For the senior capstone we were tasked with creating an ePortfolio. I initially used Google sites to create my portfolio.
                    This type of website creation is known as "What You See is What You Get" (WYSIWYG). It was my first time using one of these. 
                    Up until then I created my websites from scratch, but I figured it was worth becoming familiar with this web technology as well.
                    While I found that it does speed up site creation, it is very limiting. You must follow the premade templates in terms of style and 
                    even structure for some parts.
                </p>
                <p> After using it to create my first ePortfolio I decided I was not a fan of using WYSIWYG, but I did like how the website looked. As
                     a result, I challenged myself to recreate it from scratch. This website is the product of that personal challenge.

                <div>HTML and CSS</div>
                <p>This ePortfolio is the most complex website I have ever created in terms of structure and styling. I ran into many different problems, but
                    I was determined to solve them and get as a close as possible to the original. I even decided to attempt to make the website
                    web responsive. It is my first time at doing this kind of web development. My previous websites were not web responsive.
                    I find that it adds another layer of difficulty since you must consider the various kinds of screens.

                <div>Progress of the website</div>
                <p> Here you can see some of the trouble I was having while developing this website. This was the Showcase webpage
                    in particular. I trying to determine how to make it into a grid like the original. This website was really challenging,
                    but at the same time it was really fun to make.

                <div>Low Fidelity Wireframe for project subpages</div>
                <p> The project subpages are the only part of the website that were not in the original ePortfolio. Since I Had 
                    no template to go off of I decided to quickly create my own low fidelity wireframe. There is also a high fidelity
                    version that helped me visualize what I wanted to do for these pages. Overall, I managed to use a lot of the experience
                    I gained during the information science program.
