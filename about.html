            <h1>My Biography</h1>

            <p>My name is Gene Starr. My parents come from Peru, but I was born in Tampa, 
            Florida. We lived in Tampa for 21 years until we moved down to Wimauma. Because of my 
            family’s background I am able to understand Spanish. My areas of interest are 
            programming and web development.</p>

	        <p>During my time at the University of South Florida (USF), I completed various 
            courses that have strengthened my understanding of web development as they have 
            built upon each other. The Database Concepts course introduced me to databases, 
            creating them, and using them through Microsoft Access. I also learned the basics of 
            Structed Query Language (SQL) through the course. The WWW Page 
            Design/Management course introduced me to building webpages with HyperText 
            Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and File Transfer Protocol 
            (FTP) programs. Web Design Technologies would expand on these by teaching me 
            how to create a website with greater interactivity through JavaScript and connecting 
            websites to databases with PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP). This course would 
            also be my introduction to wireframes. The Information Architecture course greatly 
            enhanced my understanding of designing information environments with usability in 
            mind through the use of various systems that involve organization, labels, search, and 
            navigation.</p>

            <p>I also have general programming experience. A programming concepts course 
            exposed me to the Python language. An Object-Oriented Programming class would 
            give me some experience in Java. In both courses I would learn concepts such as 
            creating functions and Arrays.</p>

            <p>For the last couple of years, I had been working at an Advance Auto Parts as my 
            first job to help my family. I would be a key holding Salesperson and considered a 
            manager on duty. I learned valuable skills that would translate well into other work 
            environments. Such as communicating with clients and coworkers. Collaborating with 
            coworkers that have different levels of experience. Problem solving by addressing the 
            issues clients would have or problems with inventory. Adaptability since I would have to 
            learn how to use new tools, applications, adjusting planograms to fit properly, and processing 
            purchases manually during power outages. Attention to detail since I would ensure the floor 
            would be completely front and faced as well as completing cycle counts and outages to keep 
            inventory in check. Time management helped me prepare callbacks to send to the warehouse on schedule, 
            manage truck shipments, and complete planograms in a timely manner.</p>

            <p>I do also have some volunteer experience. For 2025 I assisted with cleaning up 
            in Tampa. One time was for general clearing of fallen branches and debris on Bayshore 
            to prepare for a garden. Another time was to help with cleaning efforts after Gasparilla 
            in Downtown Tampa by the Riverwalk. I plan to do more this year as I believe they are 
            fun activity to do with family and friends. There is a great sense of pride in 
            the community when it unites to take care of the environment that we love and call home.</p>
